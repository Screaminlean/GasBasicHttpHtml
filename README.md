Apps Script Basic Html Projects Repo
====================================

This repo is a set of very basic google apps script web app projects showing basic setup and depolyment
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you keep following this repo you will build up to more advanced apps.

You can view the apps script documentation
[here](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/)

Before we begin there are some awsome tools that you can use that aid in
apps script develvopment, while I cant force you to use them I would
advise you to try them!

#### Tools I use:

-   [Chrome
    Browser](https://www.google.co.uk/chrome/?brand=CHBD&gclid=CjwKCAjw0JfdBRACEiwAiDTALmZ-Q53n5L4fsHfnj2nvC9w3L4igKuj61viTwF16Q9SYzZfrZ072LBoC0x0QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds&dclid=CLKf_8rQzt0CFc0w0wod3yQKtw)
    Just because of the extension below!
-   [AppsScript
    Color](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/appsscript-color/ciggahcpieccaejjdpkllokejakhkome)
    Chrome Extension that makes working with apps script easier!
-   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) Once you get
    used VS code it makes life so easy!
